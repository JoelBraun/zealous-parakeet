Todo for Javascript backend as part of event hub:
-Ability to add and remove items is provided by the RPi, so that goes on there.
-Javascript backend takes Item Names, I/O state, number of hours up, and calculates uptime total cost based on stored value from RPi.

To accomplish:
- Build Javascript backend capable of doing these calculations
- Build Universal App for RPi capable of holding and transmitting this data
- Build out event hub that allows data send and receipt of on/off state and uptime/downtime
